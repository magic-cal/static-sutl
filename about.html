        <h2>What is SUTL</h2>

        <p>
          The aim of the Southern Universities Trampoline League is to provide
          competitive trampolining to university students across the South of
          the UK in an ever-evolving format that is run by students, for
          students. The SUTL committee exists to provide a trampoline league
          that benefits all university students and supports and facilitates
          university clubs in hosting competitions.
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>History</h3>
      <p>The Southern Universities Trampoline League (SUTL) was founded in 2013 with the vision of bringing together a breadth of clubs for inter-university competitions and socials. Many annual events had been running prior to the foundation of SUTL, but
        unlike the northern half of England (NEUT), there was no organisation or scoring ‘league’ to unify those in the south. The new committee established SUTL and sent an appeal to university clubs to affiliate. The response was overwhelmingly positive
        and SUTL has continued to grow. With the income from affiliation fees, the committee were able to invest in high quality medals and trophies, electronic scoring equipment and video analysis, branding material, event management kit, and website
        platforms. Future income from events and affiliation fees will allow us to maintain these platforms and continue investing in awards and equipment.</p>
      <h3> How Does it Work?</h3>
      <p> SUTL operates within university competitions, providing the competition structure to unify the events. Scores attained by eligible university members at these events contribute towards an overall university score, in addition to individual and synchronised
        medals that are calculated from performance across the competitive season. There are five events in the SUTL competition season, with top scores for each university and individual/pair counting towards end-of-year awards. Hosting universities
        facilitate these events in coordination with the SUTL Committee, and are also free to add additional events (such as roulette synchronised, DMT, etc.), with events usually followed by a themed social.
